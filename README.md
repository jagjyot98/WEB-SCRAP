Scrapping weather forecast data using Pandas and BeautifulSoup. Contains Jupiter file (having all the comments for easy understanding) and .py file , with a csv file containing the generated data from program. URL for webpage from where whole data has been generated is given in README. 

URL for the Webpage -> https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=34.05349000000007&lon=-118.24531999999999#.XoelzYgzZPY

There are many print statements in the program at almost every step to get a clear understanding of working of the program. To run them simply uncomment( remove '#' from the beginning). 
[ Recommend -> Uncomment one print statement at a time. ]
Also ther are many comments (esp. in '.ipynb' Jupiter file) giving the basic idea about each step, making it easy for even a beginner to get a basic understanding of web scrapping.
CSv file will be generated only ONCE by the last statement in the program code (remove '#' from begining) and will be updated every time the statement runs in the program.
Here CSV file contains forecast data for the day I am uploadimg it, just for giving an idea about it. 
CSV File can be used for further data manipulation or as a survey.
